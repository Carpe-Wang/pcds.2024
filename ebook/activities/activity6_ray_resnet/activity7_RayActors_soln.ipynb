    "### Exercise 9: Communicating Ray Actors (solutions code at bottom)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a short exercise to demonstrate how actors can communicate through remote oids.\n",
    "We are going to break the actors of the ImageNet classification [Example XX](RayImageNet.ipynb) into \n",
    "two actors: one that transforms the image into an ResNet50 compatible tensor and one that takes\n",
    "the tensor as input and returns the classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been given two class files that have been written to be instantiated as Ray actors:\n",
    "  * [rayresnet50_normalize](../rayresnet50_normalize.py)\n",
    "  * [rayresnet50_classify](../rayresnet50_classify.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the exercise you need to populate the following driver code.  Then answer the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is from https://github.com/EliSchwartz/imagenet-sample-images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: check your ouput to make sure that the predictions match the input file. This classifier should be over 90% correct. You need to be careful to match the return OIDs with files. **Include the cell output in submitted notebook**."

    "\n",
    "Serial. Classification blocks waits on OID of normalization.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Parallel. Launched independently all at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question 3: Your computation needs to collect return identifiers for the classification objects. It is not necessary to collect the OIDs of the normalization function in the driver code. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "The normalization oids are passed to the classification functions. Only need classification oids to get returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question 4: At any given point in time, how many actors are running and what are they doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "8 actors. 4 classification. 4 normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question 5: Is this implementation faster or slower than doing the same work in one actor?  Can you think of a situation in which it would be faster to decompose the code?  (By situation, I mean data properties or target hardware system on which this would be prefereable.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Faster if you had different hardware, e.g. GPU for classification.  Other ideas OK."
